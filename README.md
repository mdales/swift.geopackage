# GeoPackage

A minimal Swift library to extract geometry features from a GeoPackage. It contains within it code for decoding WKBGeometry data.

Very much work in progress :)

## Testing

In the 'Scripts' directory is a python script for using GDAL/OGR to generate test-cases for the library to decode.
